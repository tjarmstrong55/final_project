                <h2>Current Projects</h2>
                <p>One of my main current projects is Solid Comics, where I manage the operational and financial side of
                    the business. I oversaw the full legal setup—forming the LLC, securing vendor licenses, and
                    completing required state and tax filings. I also build pricing models, structure our sales
                    strategy, and work on improving revenue across online listings and live auctions. My business
                    partner focuses on inventory acquisition and day-to-day product management, while I handle the
                    financial systems, compliance, and growth strategy that keep the operation running smoothly.</p>

                <h2>Past Projects</h2>
                <p>One of my key past projects was Coolax, a business I owned and operated from 2017 to 2022. I ran
                    every part of the operation—finances, budgeting, sales, fulfillment, and day-to-day management.
                    Becoming the owner of it in middle school and growing it through high school gave me early
                    experience in real business operations and financial discipline. I closed the business in 2022 to
                    focus on college and larger projects, but the hands-on skills I built continue to shape how I
                    approach work today.</p>
