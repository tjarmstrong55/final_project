                        <h3>My Background</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am a Finance major at the University of Cincinnati with a minor in Economics. My academic
                            work centers on financial modeling, investment analysis, and understanding how data can be
                            used to guide stronger business decisions.
                            <br><br>
                            Outside of coursework, I actively build real-world experience through my businesses—Solid
                            Comics, ACH DataWorks, and my ongoing development projects. Each of these ventures pushes me
                            to learn more about financial strategy, operations, and the practical side of running a
                            business.

                            My strengths fall at the intersection of finance, analytics, and systems. I enjoy breaking
                            down complex information and rebuilding it into simple, useful insights. Some areas I focus
                            on include:

                        <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
                        <p>
                            I’m motivated by building things, whether it be businesses, systems, tools, and solutions that actually
                            make people’s work easier. I’ve always been hands-on, whether it was running my first
                            business in middle school or developing analytics dashboards today.
                            <br><br>
                            I enjoy long-term thinking, strategic planning, and the challenge of taking an idea from
                            concept to a fully functioning operation. My goal is always the same: find the most
                            efficient, practical way to get something done—and do it at a high standard.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
                        <p>
                            I like to stay balanced with a mix of hobbies that keep me informed, creative, and active. I spend a lot of time reading and following current events, especially anything tied to business, economics, or technology. 
                            <br></br>
                            I also enjoy playing video games and watching movies and TV as a way to unwind and get inspired creatively. And when I’m not at my desk, I’m usually watching or coaching football — it’s a big part of my life and something I genuinely enjoy being involved in.
