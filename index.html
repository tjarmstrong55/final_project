                        <p>
                            One of my main current projects is Solid Comics, where I manage the operational and
                            financial
                            side of the business. I oversaw the full legal setup—forming the LLC, securing vendor
                            licenses,
                            and completing required state and tax filings. I also build pricing models, structure our
                            sales
                            strategy, and work on improving revenue across online listings and live auctions. My
                            business
                            partner focuses on inventory acquisition and day-to-day product management, while I handle
                            the
                            financial systems, compliance, and growth strategy that keep the operation running smoothly.

                        <h3>Past Projects</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of my key past projects was Coolax, a business I owned and operated from 2017 to 2022.
                            I ran every part of the operation—finances, budgeting, sales, fulfillment, and day-to-day
                            management. Becoming the owner of it in middle school and growing it through high school
                            gave me early experience in real business operations and financial discipline. I closed the
                            business in 2022 to focus on college and larger projects, but the hands-on skills I built
                            continue to shape how I approach work today.

                        <p>
                            I’m a University of Cincinnati student majoring in Finance with a minor in Economics.
                            My work centers on data-driven problem solving, analyzing financial trends, and improving
                            business operations. I focus on turning complex information into clear, practical insights
                            that support smarter decisions.
